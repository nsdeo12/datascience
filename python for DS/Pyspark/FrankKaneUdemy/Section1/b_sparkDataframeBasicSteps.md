# Steps:
 - create spark session
 - create a app name
 - create a data frame to read a file  
 - (check for the path carefully)
 - show the data just imported
 - Check the schema
 - Check the columns
 - Summarize the table with describe 
 (returns a dataframe, show the description)

# Schema in details:
**Note:** **Schema** needs to be proper for performing various operations.
- Spark infers most of the values on its own. But its a good practice
- To provide the structure fields their respective  types)
- List of structure fields
- Initialize the structure type
- Change the dataframe to the schema defined in the last step.
