# Steps:
# 	○ create spark session
# 	○ create a app name
# 	○ create a data frame to read a file  
# 	○ (check for the path carefully)
# 	○ show the data just imported
# 	○ Check the schema
# 	○ Check the columns
# 	○ Summarize the table with describe 
# 	○ (returns a dataframe, show the description)


# Schema in details:
# 	(Schema needs to be proper for performing various operations
# 	○ Spark infers most of the values on its own. But its a good practice
# 	○ to provide the structure fields their respective  types)
# 	○ List of structure fields
# 	○ Initialize the structure type
#     ○ Change the dataframe to the schema defined in the last step.
